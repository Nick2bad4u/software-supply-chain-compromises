# Software Supply Chain Compromises - A Living Dataset

The `.csv` file in this repository represents the work by **IQT Labs** to identify
and create a living (though not breathing) dataset of publicly reported software
supply chain compromises.
Dan Geer, Bentz Tozer, and John Speed Meyers used this dataset for an article
analyzing software supply chain compromises (see the citation below).

We want and need help to maintain this dataset. Please help us maintain it by
submitting pull requests to identify mistakes we made (we're human after all)
either of commission or by omission. Importantly, this dataset will quickly go
out of date unless new attacks are added.

**Some conventions...**

- All table entries are sorted according to their `report_date`, since it is the only non-null sortable field.
- All dates in the table are in `m / d / yyyy` format.

Variants of the remote access Trojan (RAT) PlugX were found in the official releases of the three games, and appeared to target users based in certain countries in Asia. The infection chain is triggered by downloading the legitimate installer or updates for the game itself.  These compromised official releases were traced back to Garena, a consumer Internet platform provider in Asia. In an official post, Garena stated that computers and patch servers were infected with Trojans. | https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/plugx-malware-found-in-official-releases-of-league-of-legends-path-of-exile/ |  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Build, Source, and Publishing Infrastructure Attack | Publishing Infrastructure: Delivery System Compromise |
